# line_chart_PHP_JSON
line chart recalling data from JSON file

Goal with this one is to include it in a CRUD operation using either AJAX or PHPMyAdmin/MySQL to edit entries for ontime deliveries. 
However, the code is simplified and can  be used for other projects of similar scope. Just change the variables, the chart, colrs, etc and make what you want!
